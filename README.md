### Game Description 
Kingscup is a card-based game where players take turns to draw cards and follow prompts. Each unique value of a card has a prompt associated to it, and the prompts remain the same regardless of the suit of the card (i.e., there are 13 different prompts * 4 different card suits). As the name suggests, the game revolves around the cards with the "King" value, with the game ending when the 4th King has been drawn.

### Card Values and Prompts 
In this version of the game, the card's values have the following associated prompts.   
  
**'2': "Pick someone to drink!"**  
When any card with the value of 2 is drawn, the person who draws it can nominate someone to drink their beverage.  
  
**'3': "You drink!"**  
When any card with the value of 3 is drawn, the person who draws it must drink their beverage.  
  
**'4': "All GUYS drink!"**  
When any card with the value of 4 is drawn, all male players will have to drink their beverage, regardless of whether they drew the card or not.  
  
**'5': "Play Five Ten!"**  
When any card with the value of 5 is drawn, a mini-game of "Five Ten" begins. "Five Ten" requires all players to put up a hand, and for each turn in the game, all players can choose to leave their hand open (indicating a value of 5) or closed in a fist (indicating a value of 0). Players will take turns guessing the sum of all players' hands and the first to do so correctly will force the rest of the players to drink their beverage.   
  
**'6': "All LADIES drink!"**  
When any card with the value of 6 is drawn, all female players will have to drink their beverage, regardless of whether they drew the card or not.  
  
**'7': "Last person to stand up drinks!"**  
When any card with the value of 7 is drawn, all players must stand up from their seats (or sit down if they are standing for some reason). The last person to do so must drink their beverage.  
  
**'8': "Pick someone to drink with you!"**  
When any card with the value of 8 is drawn, the person who draws it can pick another player to drink their beverage with whenever they are called upon to drink their beverage within the rules of the game.   
  
**'9': "Say a word, next person must rhyme. Loser drinks!"**  
When any card with the value of 9 is drawn, the player who draws it can choose a word. All players that follow must say words that rhyme with the chosen word, and this continues until one person fails to rhyme with the chosen word. The said person must drink their beverage.  
  
**'10': "Pick a category. Go around until someone can't answer. They drink!"**  
When any card with the value of 10 is drawn, the player who draws it can choose a category. All players that follow must name objects that fit into the category, and this continues until one person fails to do so. The said person must drink their beverage.  
  
**'J': "Never Have I Ever - Everyone puts up 3 fingers. First to drop all fingers drinks!"**  
When any card with the value of J is drawn, a mini-game of "Never Have I Ever" begins. "Never Have I Ever" requires all players to put up 3 fingers. For each turn in the game, players will say something that they have never done before (e.g. "Never have I ever travelled to Sweden"). Players who have done the said thing before (e.g. If they have travelled to Sweden / live in Sweden) will put a finger down. The first player(s) who put all their fingers down will have to drink their beverage.  
  
**'Q': "Silent Queen - No one can talk to you until the next Queen. Rule-breakers drink!"**  
When any card with the value of Q is drawn, the person who drew the card can not be spoken to throughout the game until the next card with the value of Q is drawn. Anyone who speaks to the said player must drink their beverage.  
  
**'K': "King's Cup! Pour a bit of your drink into the cup. The 4th King drinks it all!"**   
When any card with the value of K is drawn, the person who drew the card can pour something into a cup. When the 4th King (card with the value of K) is drawn, the game ends and the person who draws the 4th King must drink the entire cup regardless of what is inside the cup.  
  
**'A': "Set a new rule that lasts the game! Be creative!"**  
When any card with the value of A is drawn, the person who drew the card can set a new rule that all players must adhere to until the next card with the value of A is drawn (e.g. All conversations must now be in Swiss-German). Anyone who breaks this rule must drink their beverage.  
  
    
## Disclaimer
*Do note that we do not promote irresponsible drinking nor do we encourage the ingestion of alcoholic beverages. The game mainly revolves around the ingestion of a beverage, which can include non-alcoholic drinks, sauces/condiments (i.e. spicy Siracha sauces), and can even include non-liquids (where the person who draws the 4th King will still have to eat what is in the cup.)*

### Operational Guide (tbc on the 17th/18th when we meet up)
To play the game, the user must first run the code in the terminal. Once done, they must select the tab that has the words "King's Cup" and click "Play" to begin the game. The game will automatically end when the tab is exited or when the 4th King has been drawn, and the user can choose to quit or play the game again.
